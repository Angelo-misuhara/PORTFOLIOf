My journey as a web developer has been a fascinating intersection of technology and problem-solving. Specializing in the <span className='text-[#D24545]'>MERN</span> stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), I've delved into both frontend and backend development.
          Throughout this journey, I've not only excelled academically but also applied my learning to personal projects. My skill set includes proficiency in <span className='text-[#D24545]'>Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mysql, and Jest</span>. I take pride in turning concepts into code that makes an impact.Beyond programming, you'll find me indulging in 10-hour power naps on the couch. This downtime not only refreshes me but also allows me to reconnect with myself.Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my journey and the projects I've undertaken. Thank you for stopping by!</h1>
